        <p>The sport that I like to play the most is <strong>Soccer</strong>. It helps build up muscles
        for your legs and helps increasing your footwork. I also like the teamwork in this sport.</p>

           When we are bored, my little sister and I watch the show <strong>Denis and Me</strong>, which is made by a Youtuber called DenisDaily.
           I watch many other shows including cartoons and I think this is one of my favourites.

           Another thing to know about me is that I have a lot of hobbies and a really interesting skill-set.
           One of the things I like to do is to display magic tricks to people and mostly my friends.
           I think that its nice to show tricks to people and make their day.

           I am also a gamer, and some of my favourite type of games are battle royale and games that require people to create strategies.
           With gaming, you need to have a certain skill-set for these types of games such as hand-eye coordination and positioning.
